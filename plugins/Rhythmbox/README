This is an example Rhythmbox plugin.

It is a tweaked version of the art-display plugin that ships with rhythmbox.

It will change the Rhythmbox task icon to match the cover art. If there is no 
cover art, it will unset the icon.


INSTALLATION
############

copy artdisplay-awn and artdisplay-awn.rb-plugin to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins
