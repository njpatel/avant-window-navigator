New Features In SVN (newest first):

*  You can now choose between Awn style arrows, or the "dock" style arrows, and also the arrow colour. Ammended avant-preferences to match.

*  Text has background! You can load up avant-preferences and set the background color. If you don't like it, just set the background color alpha to transparent. The drawing is a bit pixelated sometimes, but I am working on it!

*  Dual screen support! Look under /apps/avant-window-navigator/ and set the monitor_width and monitor_height variables. Then set force_monitor to TRUE, and start up Awn. ATM this only works for the 1st screen. Single screen users should not be affected.

*  Added a new mouse-over effect, it is extreme alpha software, so be careful! Activate it by starting up GConf editor, go to /apps/avant-window-navigator/app/ and set  'fade_effect' to TRUE. Don't report bugs! I know them already, however report new ideas!

*  New preference window to accomodate the separator settings.
*  You can have a separator between them
*  Launchers and tasks are now in two different hboxs.
*  1 sec delay before a window activates while you are dragging.
*  Bar now has menu for proper exit. Right click on either edge of the bar.
*  Drag anywhere on bar, not just on another icon.
*  Drag & Drop support for URIs on launchers! Including multiple files!
