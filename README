New Features In SVN (newest first):

*  Added a new mouse-over effect, it is extreme alpha software, so be careful! Activate it by starting up GConf editor, go to /apps/avant-window-navigator/app/ and set  'fade_effect' to TRUE. Don't report bugs! I know them already, however report new ideas!

*  New preference window to accomodate the separator settings.
*  You can have a separator between them
*  Launchers and tasks are now in two different hboxs.
*  1 sec delay before a window activates while you are dragging.
*  Bar now has menu for proper exit. Right click on either edge of the bar.
*  Drag anywhere on bar, not just on another icon.
*  Drag & Drop support for URIs on launchers! Including multiple files!
