New Features In SVN (newest first):

* Beryl thumbnail works now, thanks to some help from its creator! If it doesn't work straight away, just click a window or launcher on the bar, and everything should work perfectly :).

* You can now add menu's through dbus! Check out the new Rhythmbox plugin in /plugins/Rhythmbox. Installation is the same as before!

* Awn catches theme-changes signals and updates the launcher icons (window icons are automatic)

* Autohide now supports D&D

* Merged patch by James Willcox that makes the hover effect actually 'bounch' rathe rthan just go up and down.

* Fixed LOTS of small errors & warnings (thanks to Chirstian Kirbach). I fixed what was remaining, plus startup errors, separator positioning errors, and a memory leak in awn-x.c

* Elementry autohide support :). set /apps/avant-window-navigator/auto_hide to TRUE. Once hidden, the 'hot spot' is the bottom 2px of you monitor. It doesn't always hide, but I am working on it. Also, I promise to make it look cooler!

* Awn now has a dbus backend :). Look under 'plugins' for an example. Chck blog for more info, and how to write your own.

****NOTICE*** fade_effect won't work for a while as I am rethinking the effect code.

* Middle-clicking an active launcher will launch that application again. (Modified the patch by Tervi55)

* You can optionally have a notification when a window title changes, byt settings /apps/avant-window-navigator/app/name_change_notify to TRUE. Patch by trevi55.

* Optionally sets _NET_WM_STRUT & _NEW_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL (that means that windows don't go under Awn when they are maximised ;) If you want to activate this behaviour, set '/apps/avant-window-navigator/panel_mode' to TRUE. If you switch it off again, you'll have to restart Awn to see the changes.

*  Made the separator slightly smoother, it still needs work!

*  You can now choose between Awn style arrows, or the "dock" style arrows, and also the arrow colour. Ammended avant-preferences to match.

*  Text has background! You can load up avant-preferences and set the background color. If you don't like it, just set the background color alpha to transparent. The drawing is a bit pixelated sometimes, but I am working on it!

*  Dual screen support! Look under /apps/avant-window-navigator/ and set the monitor_width and monitor_height variables. Then set force_monitor to TRUE, and start up Awn. ATM this only works for the 1st screen. Single screen users should not be affected.

*  Added a new mouse-over effect, it is extreme alpha software, so be careful! Activate it by starting up GConf editor, go to /apps/avant-window-navigator/app/ and set  'fade_effect' to TRUE. Don't report bugs! I know them already, however report new ideas!

*  New preference window to accomodate the separator settings.
*  You can have a separator between them
*  Launchers and tasks are now in two different hboxs.
*  1 sec delay before a window activates while you are dragging.
*  Bar now has menu for proper exit. Right click on either edge of the bar.
*  Drag anywhere on bar, not just on another icon.
*  Drag & Drop support for URIs on launchers! Including multiple files!
